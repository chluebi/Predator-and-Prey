# Predator and Prey

A framework for simulating Predator/Prey interactions via Newton's Method. This was made when working on a paper on Lotka Volterra Models. The paper is not available publicly.

# How to Use
It is not advised that you use this framework for anything as better versions of it already exist in standard libraries.
If you truly want to use it, you can extend the Model class and write in your own populations, constants etc.
